Gonum is a set of packages designed to make writing numeric and scientific
algorithms productive, performant, and scalable.

Gonum contains libraries for [matrices and linear algebra](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat);
[statistics](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat), 
[probability](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat/distuv) 
[distributions](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat/distmv), 
and [sampling](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat/sampleuv); tools for
[function differentiation](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/diff/fd), 
[integration](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/integrate/quad),
and [optimization](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/optimize);
[network](https://godoc.org/gonum.org/v1/gonum/graph) creation and analysis; and more.

We encourage you to [get started](http://gonum.org/post/introtogonum/) with Go and Gonum if

* You are tired of sluggish performance, and fighting C and vectorization.
* You are struggling with managing programs as they grow larger.
* You struggle to re-use -- even the code you tried to make reusable.
* You would like easy access to parallel computing.
* You want code to be fully transparent, and want the ability to read the source code you use.
* You'd like a compiler to catch mistakes early, but hate fighting linker and unintelligible compile errors.
